## wavelet-image-compression
Simple FPGA-based Wavelet Image Compression component and an example usage.  
This is a sample solution to our laboratory exercise *Image compression with Discrete Wavelet Transform* published in the scope of the EU-FP7 project [*Embedded Engineering Learning Platform*](http://www.e2lp.org/).  
Link to the laboratory exercise containing full text of the assignment: [Image compression with Discrete Wavelet Transform](http://moodle.e2lp.org/course/view.php?id=5&section=65) (select ```Login as guest```).  
Description of the implemented solution can be found [here](documentation/wavelet-solution-documentation_v1.1.pdf).
